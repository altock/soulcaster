# 72-Hour Revenue Sprint Plan

This plan is a concrete, time-boxed execution path to generate **actual revenue within 72 hours** using the current Soulcaster stack and the design-partner offer described in `business_plan_cfo.md` and `documentation/revenue_week1_mrr_plan.md`.

The focus is on landing **1–2 paying design partners** (ideally at ~$99/month) by combining existing product capabilities with aggressive but targeted outreach.

## Assumptions

- Soulcaster backend, dashboard, and coding agent work end-to-end for at least one internal repo (even if a bit rough).
- You can:
  - Edit the repo/README.
  - Share a Google Doc or Notion page.
  - Send emails/DMs/LinkedIn messages to potential users.
- Goal is **cash in (or subscription started) within 72 hours**, not a perfect product.

## Hour 0–24 — Clarify Offer, Prove Flow, Start Outreach

### 1. Offer & Assets (2–4 hours)

- [ ] Re-read `business_plan_cfo.md` and `documentation/revenue_week1_mrr_plan.md` and lock in:
  - [ ] Target ICP (company size, stack, pain).
  - [ ] Design-partner offer and pricing (e.g., `$99/month` for one repo).
- [ ] Create a short **Design Partner Brief** (Google Doc or Notion):
  - [ ] Problem and who it’s for.
  - [ ] What Soulcaster does (sources, clustering, PR generation).
  - [ ] Design-partner pricing and expectations.
  - [ ] What you’re asking from them (time, repo, feedback).
- [ ] Add a simple **“Paid Design Partner” section** to `README.md` or project landing surface:
  - [ ] 3–5 lines describing the offer.
  - [ ] A link to the Design Partner Brief.

### 2. Internal Dry Run (1–2 hours)

- [ ] Run through the full flow on an internal/sandbox repo:
  - [ ] Ingest or create at least one piece of feedback.
  - [ ] Confirm cluster appears in the dashboard.
  - [ ] Trigger the coding agent and produce a PR.
- [ ] Capture:
  - [ ] 1–2 screenshots or a short Loom-style recording of the flow.
  - [ ] A concrete example you can describe on calls (“here’s a bug we fixed via Soulcaster in our own repo”).

### 3. Lead List & First Outreach (3–6 hours)

- [ ] Build a **short, high-quality lead list** (aim for 15–25 names):
  - [ ] Warm network (friends, ex-colleagues, alumni, communities).
  - [ ] Visible maintainers of repos with active bug/issue traffic on GitHub.
- [ ] For each lead, capture:
  - [ ] Company, role, key repo(s).
  - [ ] Evidence of bug/backlog pain (issues, incidents, “bug” labels).
- [ ] Draft **2 outbound message templates**:
  - [ ] One for warm intros.
  - [ ] One for cold-but-targeted outreach.
- [ ] Send **at least 10 personalized messages**:
  - [ ] Link to the Design Partner Brief.
  - [ ] Clear ask: “Can we do a 20–30 min call in the next 48 hours to see if this can close some of your bug backlog?”

---

## Hour 24–48 — Conversations, Live Demos, More Outreach

### 4. Calls & Demos (4–8 hours)

- [ ] Book and run as many short calls as possible with responders:
  - [ ] Spend first ~10 minutes on their current bug/incident workflow and pain.
  - [ ] Show the internal Soulcaster flow (or a staging environment) live.
  - [ ] Ask explicitly: “If we get you at least one useful PR in the first month, is `$99/month` for this repo reasonable?”
- [ ] Take brief notes after each call:
  - [ ] Pain level (low/medium/high).
  - [ ] Objections (trust, security, value, workflow).
  - [ ] Next step (trial, repo details, follow-up date).

### 5. Extend Outreach (2–4 hours)

- [ ] Expand the lead list to **30–40 total** if you have capacity:
  - [ ] Add a few targeted cold leads (GitHub repos, community contacts).
- [ ] Send another **10–15 messages** incorporating early feedback:
  - [ ] Adjust language around value (time saved, bugs closed).
  - [ ] Add 1–2 concrete examples from your internal use.

### 6. Make it Easy to Say “Yes” (1–2 hours)

- [ ] Set up a simple payment/subscription link (Stripe or equivalent).
- [ ] Define a **clear “start” checklist**:
  - [ ] Access you need (GitHub, tokens).
  - [ ] One target repo.
  - [ ] One initial class of bugs/issues to aim at.
- [ ] Prepare a **one-page onboarding checklist** you can send after a verbal “yes”.

---

## Hour 48–72 — Close, Onboard, and Ship Value

### 7. Closing Conversations (3–6 hours)

- [ ] Revisit every open conversation from the first 48 hours:
  - [ ] Send follow-ups to clarify open questions or objections.
  - [ ] Offer to walk through the checkout and setup live on a call.
- [ ] For any lead that seems like a solid fit:
  - [ ] Propose a concrete start date (within days, not weeks).
  - [ ] Share the payment link and onboarding checklist.
  - [ ] Ask for repo details and a point person on their side.

### 8. Fast Onboarding & First Win (3–6 hours)

- [ ] For each design partner who signs up:
  - [ ] Configure their repo and environment according to the checklist.
  - [ ] Identify 1–3 candidate bugs/issues that Soulcaster can realistically target first.
  - [ ] Run the full Soulcaster flow to produce at least one PR.
  - [ ] Notify them with:
    - [ ] Link to the PR.
    - [ ] Short explanation of what it fixes and how to validate.

### 9. Measure and Document (1–2 hours)

- [ ] At the end of 72 hours, write down:
  - [ ] Number of leads contacted.
  - [ ] Number of calls held.
  - [ ] Number of “yes, let’s try it” responses.
  - [ ] Number of actual subscriptions/revenue (MRR) started.
- [ ] Capture a short internal summary:
  - [ ] What worked best in outreach.
  - [ ] Top 3 objections or blockers.
  - [ ] Concrete product changes that would have unlocked more deals.
- [ ] Feed insights back into:
  - [ ] `documentation/revenue_week1_mrr_plan.md` (adjust Week 1 expectations).
  - [ ] `tasks/mvp_todos.md` (add/adjust items that unblock future revenue sprints).

## Quick Daily Checklist (For You)

You can also use this lightweight daily checklist during the 72-hour sprint:

- [ ] Drink water before coffee and between calls.
- [ ] Do at least one short walk or stretch block.
- [ ] Ship one thing that makes Soulcaster easier to demo.
- [ ] Contact at least 5–10 real potential users.
- [ ] Move at least one conversation one step forward (e.g., from “interested” to “on a call,” or from “call” to “signed up”).
